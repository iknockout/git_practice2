Created a brand new respository in GITHUB for this exercise, hence the name
git_practice2.  When I updated README.txt in webDev*/git_practice/ and tried to
push it, I got the following --

~/Codecademy/webDev_class_2017/git_practice> git push -u origin master
remote: Invalid username or password.
fatal: Authentication failed for 'https://github.com/iknockout/git_practice.git/'

---------
Just tried to push (above) again and this time the push was successful!
I'm thinking I must have changed my GITHUB pw.  The GITHUB credential was updated when I created a new repo (this git_practice2) as it prompted me for username+pw.
